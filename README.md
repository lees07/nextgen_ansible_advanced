# Notes of GPTE Ansible Advanced Homework  
  
## PoC requirements:  

An Ansible playbook project on Ansible Tower to deploy the three tier application to QA and PROD environments.  
QA environment is based on Openstack which is behind the firewall, so all operations need to run on a workstation.  
The instances for deploying application will create on demand.
PROD environment is on AWS, it is on demand also.  
Three tier application includes load balancer, web container and database. Deploying three tier application to QA and PROD environment will use one module.  
Deployment sequence are following:  
1. Preparing QA & PROD environment concurrently.  
2. Deploying 3 tier application on QA environment, and testing. If test failed then delete QA environment instances.  
3. On test success and PROD environment ready, deploying 3 tier application on PROD environment, and doing the final test.  


### Deployment Architecture
![Diagram of PoC deployment architecture](/images/deployment-arch.png)  


### Guidance
Design and implements guidance are following:  
* Use a clear and consistent style  
* Make sure that plays and tasks are self-documenting, with clear and meaningful names  
* Make sure that the repositories are fully self-contained  
* MitziCom is adopting an Infrastructure as Code policy going forward  
* Use roles extensively to achieve a high degree of reuse and modularity  
* Make sure that optimal modules are used throughout  
* Use templates throughout, making sure they are clearly marked as "Ansible generated"  
* Use handlers where appropriate  
* Use Ansible Vault to protect sensitive information  


## Ansible workflow job template
Following the requirements, the Ansible workflow job is seperate to several jobs.

## Troubleshooting issues
1. Variable "{{ opentlc_login }}" does not set correctly in config-tower role. Fixed.  
2. Single Quotation Marks need to use when special character exist in username or password in aws_provision.yml, like:  
---
    - name: create credentials
      copy:
        content: |
          export username='{{ param_user }}'
          export password='{{ param_password }}'
          export uri=https://labs.opentlc.com
        dest: /root/credential.rc
        mode: 0755

## Some document errors   
Sector 4.3.5, the internal repo with 192.168.0.5 can't be accessed.  
---
5. Configure your instance to use the organizationâ€™s local yum repository, 
http://www.opentlc.com/download/ansible_bootcamp/repo/internal.repo  
---

Sector 4.4.2, the item name in command will be "Ansible Advanced - Three Tier App"  
---
source credential.rc ; ./order_svc.sh -y -c 'OPENTLC Automation' -i 'Ansible Advanced' -t 1 -d 'dialog_expiration=7;region=na;nodes=1;dialog_runtime=8'
